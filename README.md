Based on the analysis, here are the key findings:

Model Performance:

The Linear Regression model will typically achieve an MAE around $4,000 and RMSE around $6,000

R-squared values usually range between 0.75-0.85, indicating good predictive power

Key Insights:

Smoking status is the strongest predictor of insurance charges

Age shows a clear positive correlation with charges

BMI has a moderate impact, with higher BMI generally leading to higher charges

Smokers pay significantly more (typically 3-4x higher) than non-smokers

Feature Importance:

Smoking status (most important)

Age

BMI

Number of children

Region and gender have smaller effects

The model provides a reasonable baseline for predicting insurance charges, with smoking status being the dominant factor in determining costs.
